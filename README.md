# Acitivity_tracker
This project is a multi-OS activity tracker daemon that monitors user activity, categorizes it into Work, Private, Idle, and Uncategorized, and generates structured JSON logs. The application runs in the background, tracking active windows, detecting system lock status, and storing categorized data in real-time.
